# Copilot instructions for National-Control-Consulting

**Purpose:** Help AI coding agents be productive quickly in this small static-site repo.

## Project snapshot (big picture)
- Minimal static website (no backend) built from files in `project-root/` and output to `public/` via Parcel.
- Key source files: `project-root/index.html`, `project-root/style.css`, `project-root/script.js`, `project-root/create_logo.py`.
- Build output: `public/` (committed in repo but regenerated by `npm run build`).

## How to run and build (exact commands)
- Local development (hot-reload):
  - `npm install` then `npm run dev` (Parcel serves `project-root/index.html` on port **3000**).
- Production build:
  - `npm run build` — builds into `public/` (uses `parcel build` with `--dist-dir public --public-url ./`).
  - `npm run preview` — runs `npm run build` then `python3 -m http.server --directory public 8000` to preview.

## Special build behavior / "coming soon"
- Build includes a conditional: if a file named `.coming_soon` exists in repo, or env var `COMING_SOON=1` is set, then `project-root/coming-soon.html` is copied to `public/index.html` (see `package.json` `build` script).
- There are helper scripts that create/remove `.coming_soon` and commit/push the change:
  - `npm run enable-coming-soon` (creates, commits, and pushes `.coming_soon` to `main`)
  - `npm run disable-coming-soon`
- CAUTION: these helpers run `git commit` and `git push` — do not run them in forks/PR branches without explicit intent.

## Assets and generated files
- Placeholder logo generator: `project-root/create_logo.py` — runs standalone and will try to install Pillow if missing. It writes `project-root/images/logo.png` (default 512x512). Use `LOGO_SIZE` env var to change size: `LOGO_SIZE=256 python3 project-root/create_logo.py`.
- After `npm run build`, the `public/images/logo.png` will be produced by bundling the source images.

## Project conventions & patterns worth noting
- Very small, intentionally simple: HTML/CSS/JS only, no frameworks. Keep changes minimal and predictable.
- Parcel is used only for convenience (dev server + build). Don't add heavy JS frameworks unless there is a strong justification.
- No automated tests or CI files in repo — if you add tests/tools, include README updates and explicit run scripts in `package.json`.
- The repository contains a committed `public/` directory (build artifacts). When modifying build output, prefer changing `project-root/` source files and re-running `npm run build` (rather than editing `public/` directly).

## Editing guidelines for AI agents (how to make safe, helpful edits)
- Provide minimal, reversible changes. For content or stylistic updates, change `project-root/` files and run `npm run build` to validate output.
- When adding scripts or workflow changes that run `git` (e.g., enabling/disabling features), leave a note in the commit message and don't run `enable-coming-soon` automatically — it pushes to `main`.
- Use explicit, small commits and include short test steps in the PR description (e.g., commands to run: `npm run dev`, or `npm run build && python3 -m http.server --directory public 8000`).

## Files to reference in PR descriptions / code reviews
- `package.json` (scripts & build behavior)
- `project-root/index.html`, `project-root/style.css`, `project-root/script.js` (primary source)
- `project-root/create_logo.py` (logo generation behavior)

## Examples of useful prompts for maintainers or reviewers
- "Make the CTA button color `#0066cc` and ensure both local dev (`npm run dev`) and `npm run build` reflect the change." 
- "Add an accessibility label to the contact form submit button in `project-root/index.html` and confirm the build output under `public/` updates."

## Cloudflare Pages note ⚠️
- If you use Cloudflare Pages, **do not** add a custom deploy command that runs `npx wrangler deploy` unless you intend to deploy Workers or static assets with Wrangler.
- This repo is a static site built to `public/`; a `npx wrangler deploy` without a `wrangler.toml` or `--assets` will fail and prevent Pages from publishing the new build (the site will keep serving the last successful deployment).
- To fix: in Cloudflare Pages UI (Project → Settings → Build & Deploy) remove the custom deploy command or set it to a safe command (e.g., leave it blank). After you remove it, re-trigger a build (push an empty commit or use the Pages UI to redeploy).

If you'd like, I can: add brief tests to validate site builds, or create a small `README.dev.md` with the commands above. What part would you like me to expand or clarify? 👇
