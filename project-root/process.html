            <h2>What Happens When You Hire Us</h2>
        </section>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h2>1. Initial Call & Scope Review</h2>
            <p>We start with a phone call or video meeting to understand your project status, specific issues, and timeline constraints.</p>
            <p>You'll get an initial assessment of what's likely needed and a clear scope proposal.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h2>2. Drawing & System Review</h2>
            <p>If applicable, we review electrical plans, control diagrams, submittals, and any existing documentation to identify potential issues before stepping on-site.</p>
            <p>For troubleshooting calls, we may request photos or video of installed equipment to speed up diagnosis.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h2>3. Coordination with Field Teams</h2>
            <p>We work directly with your electricians, project managers, or facilities staff — not as another layer of management, but as hands-on support.</p>
            <p>Communication is direct, practical, and focused on solving the problem.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h2>4. On-Site or Remote Support</h2>
            <p>Depending on the project, we provide either in-person field support or remote troubleshooting via phone, video, and photo sharing.</p>
            <p>Remote support often resolves issues faster and at lower cost than unnecessary site visits.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h2>5. Closeout & Documentation</h2>
            <p>After issues are resolved, you receive a summary of findings, corrective actions taken, and any recommendations for final commissioning or future maintenance.</p>
            <p>Documentation is clear, concise, and ready to share with inspectors or commissioning agents.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- TRUST & TRANSPARENCY -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Trust & Transparency</h2>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h3>Clear Communication</h3>
            <p>You'll know exactly what's being done, why it's necessary, and what the next steps are. No jargon, no runaround.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>All project details, client information, and system configurations remain confidential. Your business stays your business.</p>

        <section class="section service-detail">
            <h3>Manufacturer-Agnostic</h3>
            <p>Recommendations are based on what works for your project — not product sales quotas or manufacturer relationships.</p>
            <p>If a system is flawed or inappropriate for the application, you'll hear it straight.</p>
